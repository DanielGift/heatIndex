#*** Start by importing functions from the math library.
 

#*** Prompt user to input temperature, store it in a variable & print it


#*** Prompt the user for the relative humidity, store it in a variable & print it


#*** Define a variable for each of the constants of the formula
#*** use the first of the two HI formulas - i.e. the one with "only" 9 constants
#*** found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index#Formula



#*** Compute the heat index corresponding to the temperature and humidity
#*** Split it up into three expressions to make it more readable


#*** Print the calculated heat index to 3 decimal places


#*** Print the rounded up heat index as an integer
#*** use the ceil function in the math library to round up
